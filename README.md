# Program a Tello drone to take Pictures

Based on "Program a Tello drone to take pictures and then classify the images" at https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/program-ryze-dji-tello-drone-using-sdks-and-node-red/

Use the Ryze and DJI SDKs to control their Tello drone API with Node-RED and Watson Visual Recognition nodes.

In this tutorial, we present the high-level steps from our workshop where we show you how to program a [Ryze DJI Tello Drone](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello) by using the Ryze and DJI APIs in their SDKs and Node-RED. Join the open source community, like in the [TelloPilots forums](https://tellopilots.com/), and learn how to program the Tello.
